**Simple Python CRUD Application using REST API**

This application is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system built with Python, utilizing REST APIs to interact with a backend database. It enables users to perform standard operations on data records via HTTP methods, making it easy to integrate and manage resources in a web-based environment.

### Key Features:
1. **Create**: Allows users to add new records to the database using HTTP `POST` requests.
2. **Read**: Retrieves and displays existing records via HTTP `GET` requests. Users can either view a list of all records or fetch details for a specific record using an ID.
3. **Update**: Updates existing records in the database with new data using HTTP `PUT` or `PATCH` requests.
4. **Delete**: Removes records from the database through HTTP `DELETE` requests.

### Technology Stack:
- **Python**: The core language used to implement the business logic.
- **Flask/FastAPI/Django**: (Specify the framework) used for creating and handling the RESTful APIs.
- **SQLAlchemy/MySQL**: (Specify the database) for managing the database and performing operations.
- **JSON**: Data exchange format for request and response payloads.

### API Endpoints:
- **POST /records**: Create a new record.
- **GET /records**: Retrieve all records.
- **GET /records/{id}**: Retrieve a specific record by ID.
- **PUT /records/{id}**: Update a specific record by ID.
- **DELETE /records/{id}**: Delete a specific record by ID.

### Use Cases:
- Manage entities like users, products, or any resource that requires database CRUD functionality.
- Easily integrate with frontend applications through a standard REST interface.
- Suitable for both small-scale projects or as a foundation for more complex applications.
