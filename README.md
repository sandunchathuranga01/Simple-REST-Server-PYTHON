# Simple Python CRUD Application using REST API

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Python and RESTful APIs. It demonstrates basic operations on a database through API endpoints.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new records to the database via a POST request.
- **Read**: Retrieve one or all records using a GET request.
- **Update**: Modify existing records using a PUT or PATCH request.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database using a DELETE request.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask/FastAPI/Django (replace with the one you're using)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy/MySQL (replace with your database)
- **Data Format**: JSON for request/response payloads

## API Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint            | Description                       |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `POST`      | `/records`          | Create a new record               |
| `GET`       | `/records`          | Retrieve all records              |
| `GET`       | `/records/{id}`      | Retrieve a specific record by ID  |
| `PUT`       | `/records/{id}`      | Update a specific record by ID    |
| `DELETE`    | `/records/{id}`      | Delete a specific record by ID    |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Make sure your database is running and properly configured.
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   (or `uvicorn app:app` if using FastAPI)

3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000/` (or `http://localhost:8000/` for FastAPI).
